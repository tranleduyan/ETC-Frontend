# About
ECS Tool Checkout is a web-based application developed by a team of five senior Computer Science students at Seattle Pacific University. The system addresses the challenges of laboratory equipment accessibility, tracking, and reservation that students were facing due to the lack of an efficient management system at the university. Before ECS Tool Checkout, students and lab managers struggled with missing, misplaced, or insufficient equipment. The absence of a centralized reservation and tracking system led to equipment being unavailable or lost, impacting students' ability to complete assignments and projects. ECS Tool Checkout is designed to streamline equipment reservations and real-time tracking for lab managers and students. The 
application leverages RFID technology—using antennas and tags—to allow lab managers to monitor the precise location of each item in real time.

# Tech Stacks
ECS Tool Checkout leverages a modern and scalable tech stack to ensure optimal performance, flexibility, and ease of maintenance. The key technologies used in the project are:
1. **Frontend:** React.js
2. **Backend:** Node.js
3. **Serverless & Cloud Services:** AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway

# Key Features
1. **Real-time Equipment Tracking:** Using RFID technology, the system automatically tracks the location and movement of lab equipment in real time, ensures items are never lost and can be quickly located when needed, improving operational efficiency.
2. **Reservation System:** Students and faculty can easily reserve equipment for specific time slots through the intuitive platform, which effectively minimizes scheduling conflicts, ensures fair access to resources, and helps labs efficiently allocate their equipment.
3. **Inventory Management System:** Lab managers have full control over the equipment inventory, with the ability to add, update, and remove items as needed. The system helps maintain accurate stock levels, ensuring that equipment availability is always up-to-date. Additionally, the system helps them to keep all the logs of all equipment within the inventory, including maintenance history and cost.
4. **Automation Check In/Check Out:** With the help of RFID technology, the process of checking in and out equipment is fully automated. Students and faculty simply pick up or return items — no need for manual logging, saving time and reducing human error.
